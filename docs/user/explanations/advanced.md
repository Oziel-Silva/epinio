## Git Pushing

The quick way of pushing an application, as explained at
[Quickstart: Push an application](../tutorials/quickstart.md#push-an-application), uses a local
directory containing a checkout of the application's sources.


TODO: Update this (no gitea)

Internally this is actually [quite complex](detailed-push-process.md). It
involves the creation and upload of a tarball from these sources by the client
to the Epinio server, storage into Epinio's Gitea component, and then checkout
from that git repository by the tekton pipeline for staging, i.e. compilation
and creation of the docker image to be used by the underlying kubernetes
cluster.

This process can be shortend however by using the Epinio client's "git mode". In
this mode `epinio push` does not take a local directory of sources, but the
location of a git repository holding the sources, and the id of the revision to
use. The client then simply arranges for the tekton pipeline to pull directly
from that git repository instead of from the internal gitea. No tarball, no
upload, no saving to gitea.

The syntax is

```
epinio push NAME GIT-REPOSITORY-URL --git REVISION
```

For comparison all the relevant syntax:

```
epinio push NAME 
epinio push NAME DIRECTORY
epinio push NAME GIT-REPOSITORY-URL --git REVISION
```

__Attention__: While it is possible to use a branch name for the `REVISION` id,
this is not recommened at this point. We recommend to use an exact git hash
instead.  While a second push of an application with the same branch will
apparently pick up and deploy any commits done on that branch since the previous
push this may be a (fortunate) accident of the current implementation and we are
not guaranteeing this yet.

## Traefik

When you installed Epinio, it looked at your cluster to see if you had
[Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/providers/kubernetes-ingress/)
running. If it wasn't there it installed it.

As Epinio only checks two namespaces for Traefik's presence, namely
`traefik` and `kube-system`, it is possible that it tries to install
it, despite the cluster having Traefik running. Just in an unexpected
place.

The `install` command provides the option `--skip-traefik` to handle
this kind of situation.

Installing Epinio on your cluster with the command

```bash
$ epinio install --skip-traefik
```

forces Epinio to not install its own Traefik.

Note that having some other (non-Traefik) Ingress controller running
is __not__ a reason to prevent Epinio from installing Traefik. All the
Ingresses used by Epinio expect to be handled by Traefik.

Also, the Traefik instance installed by Epinio, is configured to redirect all
http requests to https automatically (e.g. the requests to the Epinio API, and
the application routes). If you decide to use a Traefik instance which you
deployed, you have to set this up yourself, Epinio won't change your Traefik
installation in any way. Here are the relevant upstream docs for the redirection:

https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/routing/entrypoints/#redirection

## Linkerd

By default, Epinio installs [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io/) on your cluster. The
various namespaces created by Epinio become part of the Linkerd Service Mesh and
thus all communication between pods is secured with mutualTLS.

In some cases you may not want Epinio to install Linkerd, either because you did
that manually before you install Epinio or for other reasons. You can provide
the `--skip-linkerd` flag to the `install` command to prevent Epinio from
installing any of the Linkerd control plane components:

```bash
$ epinio install --skip-linkerd
```

## Traefik and Linkerd

By default, with Epinio installing both Traefik and Linkerd, Epinio's
installation process ensures that the Traefik pods are included in the Linkerd
mesh, thus ensuring that external communication to applications is secured on
the leg between loadbalancer and application service.

__However__, there are situations where Epinio does not install Traefik.
This can be because the user specified `--skip-traefik`, or because Epinio
detected a running Traefik, thus can forego its own.
The latter is possible, for example, when using `k3d` as cluster foundation.

In these situations the pre-existing Traefik is __not__ part of the Linkerd
mesh. As a consequence the communication from loadbalancer to application
service is not as secure.

While it is possible to fix this, the fix requires access to the cluster in
general, and to Traefik's namespace specifically. In other words, permissions to
annotate the Traefik namespace are needed, as well as permissions to restart the
pods in that namespace. The latter is necessary, because Linkerd is not able to
inject itself into running pods. It can only intercept pod (re)starts.

### Example

Assuming that Traefik's namespace is called `traefik`, with pods
`traefik-6f9cbd9bd4-z4zw8` and `svclb-traefik-q8g75`
the commands

```
kubectl annotate namespace     traefik linkerd.io/inject=enabled
kubectl delete pod --namespace traefik traefik-6f9cbd9bd4-z4zw8 svclb-traefik-q8g75
```

will bring the Traefik in that namespace into Epinio's linkerd mesh.

Note that this recipe also works for a Traefik provided by `k3d`, in the
`kube-system` namespace.

While it is the namespace which is annotated, only restarted pods are affected
by that, i.e. Traefik's pods here. The other system pods continue to run as they
are.
